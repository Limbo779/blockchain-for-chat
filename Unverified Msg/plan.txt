-First make a proper example convo.json file (Done)
-Make a verification mechanism 
  *these are the things to be satisfied 
    -pk in convo log should match the actual pk from userlog
    -verify the signature of both parties 
  *if not satisfied it would be missing reciever signature(mostly) , so wait till we get that
- once these are verified , the msg shall be written into unverified log with all the details
- add the msg to my log with convo no of the msg and message (no other details is required)
- update the convo log wiht your sign and wait for other party to sign 

sub plan 1 :
-convert the keys to pkcs1 format and when loading it we should convert to normal key format
  * for converting to json storable
    - use : pk.save_pkcs1().decode('ascii') # basically we are decoding the binary shit to ascii
  * for converting back to normal key
    - use : rsa.PublicKey.load_pkcs1(pk.encode('ascii'))
-encode the sign to base64 and decode to base 64 when verification
